# TSINR: Capturing Temporal Continuity via Implicit Neural Representations for Time Series Anomaly Detection

## Abstract 

## Get Started


## Further Discussion

### Major experiments results
We compare our method with 11 other state-of-the-art approaches
on five multivariate datasets and one univariate dataset. As shown
in Table 2, **our method achieves superior overall performance on
these benchmark datasets**. These experimental results confirm that
TSINR, in both multivariate and univariate scenarios, effectively
captures temporal continuity and precisely identifies discontinuous
anomalies. The findings affirm the robustness of TSINR across
diverse datasets and showcase its potential for broader applications
in diverse domains

### Compared to other classical anomaly detection methods.
We compared our TSINR method with other classical anomaly detection methods, 
such as clustering-based methods (DeepSVDD and ITAD), distance-based methods (), 
or prediction-based methods.
